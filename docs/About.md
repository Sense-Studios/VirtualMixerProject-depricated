## About the author ##
Sense Studios has been innovating on the internet for years with smart video applications. She built Marduq.tv, a platform for interactive video and Webcamconsult.com, webcam chat for professionals.
One would almost forget that the company has its roots in the Veejay scene of Amsterdam. Sense could be seen in all major clubs and festivals, and she toured with DJs such as Eric E and Johan Gielen. She was also one of the founders of VJAcademy, the best school for VJs in the Netherlands.
