 *
 * @description
 *   The effect class covers a range of input-output nodes in between either sources and mixers
 *   Or mixers and mixers. It depends if the effect needs UV control whichj only works on samplers.
 *   Broadly I've split up a number of effects in
 *    * DistortionEffects, handling all kind of UV processes on samplers and more
 *    * FeedbackEffects, with an extra canvas all effects that involve layering are here
 *    * ColorEffects, all effects doing with colors, works on mixers as well
 *
 *   Connection flow:
 *   ```
 *     SOURCE ---> EFFECT1 --> MIXER --> EFFECT2 --> ... ---> OUTPUT
 *   ```
